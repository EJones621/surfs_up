Module 9: Surf's Up with AdvancedData Storage and Retrieval 

## Project Overview
The purpose of this project is to determine if a surf and ice cream shop business would do well year-round. We do this by reviewing the temperature data for the months of June and December in Oahu, HI.

## Resources
Jupyter Notebook, Python, Pandas, SQLite

## Results
1. The average temperature in June is 74.9 degrees and in December it is 71.0 degrees. So not a very wide range between the two.
2. The minimum temperature in June was 64 degrees and in December it was 56, so a wider range there than the average temperatures.
3. And to look at the maximum temperatures, in June it was 85 degrees and in December it was 83. This was the smallest range between average and minimum.

## Summary
From the analysis it is clear that Oahu, HI has great temperatures for both surfing and ice cream year-round. Based on the months that were analyzed, I don't see why this business wouldn't be sustainable. The only thing would that might need more analysis are the other months that are not accounted. Another thing that should be looked into would be other weather factors. What if there's a big tropical storm since it is Hawaii? Overall, based on the months analyzed, temperature should not be a barrier to opening the shop.
